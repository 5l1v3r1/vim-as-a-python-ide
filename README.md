# Vim as a Python IDE

This is the code for my PyCon APAC 2012 talk about Vim as Python IDE.

You can find the slides here: TODO

If you want to start using Vim for the first time, have a look at the
``.vimrc`` file in this repository and gradually uncomment everything.

Then install the plugins mentionned at the bottom of the file and you should
be good to go.
